# S Battery Tweaker
A simple app to prolong battery longevity by limiting charge rate/suspending charge based on temperature.

# Requirements
Root access or Shizuku. If none of these are possible, see setup instruction below.

# Setting up for OneUI 6.0+ (No root)
If you have Shizuku, the app will automatically install the settings database provider. This is only done once.

If you have a PC and adb, you may install [this app](https://github.com/gamemn02/Settings-Database-Provider/releases/download/v1.1/settings-database-provider-v1.1-cli.apk "this app") by running this adb command:
````
adb install --bypass-low-target-sdk-block settings-database-provider-v1.1-cli.apk
````
